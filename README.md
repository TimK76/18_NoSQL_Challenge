  ## Description

  This was a class project with the objective of building an API for an eventual Socal Media Network. I was given the following User Story and Acceptance Criteria and instructions to use MongoDB, Mongoose, Expresss.js and any JavaScript date library of my choice or the native JavaScript DATE object for formatting timestamps. The application will not be delployed but will include a [Walkthrough Vidoe]() demonstrating functionality of routes working in Insomnia. 

### User Story

    AS A social media startup
    I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
    SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

### Acceptance Criteria

    GIVEN a social network API
    WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
    THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
    WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
    THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
    WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
    THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
    WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
    THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
